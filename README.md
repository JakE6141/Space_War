# Overview 
This project involves taking what I learned from the previous LibGDX project and implementing it to a higher degree. I am pleased with the way it came out considering it is my second time using LibGDX. 
I Know there is definitely a lot for me to work on and change. Code reuse and OOP principles were used a lot here but I did notice as I went on there were a lot of places where I could have done better. 
I will definitely come back to this project to revise it and add more. I like the design and idea of it. I would want to add power ups and aspects of games like that which would make the game much longer. 
I would even like to look into publishing it on the Google Play store or itch.io.
