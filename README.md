# Overview 
This project involves taking what I learned from the previous LibGDX project and implementing it to a higher degree. I am pleased with the way it came out considering it is my second time using LibGDX. 
I Know there is definitely a lot for me to work on and change. Code reuse and OOP principles were used a lot here but I did notice as I went on there were a lot of places where I could have done better. 
I will definitely come back to this project to revise it and add more. I like the design and idea of it. I would want to add power ups and aspects of gaming which enhance the experience and would make the game much longer. 
I would even like to look into publishing it on the Google Play store or itch.io.
# Game Overview
This game is a simple pixelated 2D game where you play as a hero and try to defeat the two alien spaceships. You first have to defeat the easier alien with your cannons without losing all of your hearts. 
If you defeat this alien then the second, more difficult alien comes to attack you. You must then try to defeat this alien which was made to be a bit more difficult. Overall this game is meant to provide
a fun challenge. 
# Features
* Movement - You can use either 'W''A''S''D' or the arrow keys to move. You can move in all directions and when you go backwards the ship will flip over so you can shoot in that direction as well. This is good for gameplay and overall appearance/realism.
* Shooting - the shooting for the hero is done by pressing the space bar. The bullets are a bit faster than the spaceships so if you want to attack from behind you can. When the bullets contact the other spaceships you can see a explosion showing they have been hit, along with a sound being played. When it comes to the aliens bullets they have about the same speed but for the last alien the spaceship fires four bullets in a tighter spread.
* Lives - you are given four lives, when you are hit with a bullet you lose one. As of now their is no way to regain a heart.
* Win/Lose Screen - these end screens explain if you have won or lost, after losing you can try again, after winning you can just exit.
# Screenshots and Demo
These images are full screen to show clarity. The actual game is meant to be a small window just meant for a quick fun challenging game when bored. The bullets may seem like they are not coming out of the alien spaceships but it is just the image. Watch the video for full clarity if needed.
